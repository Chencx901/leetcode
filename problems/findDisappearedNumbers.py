Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n 
(n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]

        ans = [x for x in range(1, len(nums) + 1)]
        return list(set(ans) - set(nums))


# For each number i in nums,
# we mark the number that i points as negative.
# Then we filter the list, get all the indexes
# who points to a positive number.
# Since those indexes are not visited.
